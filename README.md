# Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks
The code in this repo was generated as I went through the book Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks. Why did I go through this book before the original one? It's a secret.

## Language 1: Lua
### Day 1
Getting used to the Lua REPL, and working through the bare essentials of the language. God I hate dynamic typing.

I found a significantly better REPL called croissant, installable via luarocks.

### Day 2
Literally just tables. And metatables. And metametatables? This seems like it would be really useful, if I spent 3 weeks relearning how I think about classes. Really, it's a very elegant language; I just can't *stand* not having typed values.

This actually makes me miss Java.

### Day 3
OH MY GOD I HATE C++.

I had to skip this day, because the homebrew version of Lua doesn't install a particular file called liblua.so that clang needs to compile a C++ project with the Lua interpreter.

This whole experience has soured my view of Lua quite significantly. Do people actually use this language to make games?

## Language 2: Factor
### Day 1
The listener/repl thing is poorly made, but actually this language is quite cool. I dread to think how that GUI library works.

### Day 2
I don't think I've ever had to work so hard for a `hello, world` program.

Having now finished this section up to (but not including) the tasks, I find it much more believable that someone could use Factor for "real" programming. Still, I don't think I'll be switching anytime soon: I'm far too indoctrinated into the applicative model.

Slight (huge) gripe: this language has terrible errors, and there's *literally* nothing online that I can reference other than the solid blank wall of the official documentation.
