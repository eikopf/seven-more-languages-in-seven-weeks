# Why This Part Isn't Finished
This part of the project requires compiling C++ code with the lua library. 

Unfortunately, the Homebrew version of Lua doesn't seem to install the required `lualib.so` file to actually build the binary, so I'm stuck here.

After this experience, and the general typeless fuckery in it, I'll admit that I'm a little sour on Lua. Oh well.
